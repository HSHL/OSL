## What is the Open Source Lab?

The Open Source Lab (OSL) at Hamm-Lippstadt University of Applied Sciences is your contact point for sustainable, free and collaborative project creation.  
Our goal is to encourage and support university members to publish hardware and software projects developed at HSHL - from small module projects to final theses - publicly, comprehensibly and under a suitable open source license.  
After all, knowledge grows when it is shared and reusability helps not only within the university, but worldwide.  

Making a project open source means more than simply uploading it:
To ensure that others can legally use, develop or improve your work, a suitable open source license is crucial.  
Don't worry - we'll help you make the right choice and show you what you need to consider.  
Sustainable documentation is also key to success.  
Whether installation, use or setup - when projects are well described, everyone benefits - others as well as you in a few years' time.  
This is where tools such as GitHub Pages come in, allowing you to do this easily and clearly.  
The OSL also teaches you how to collaborate successfully with modern tools such as Git and GitHub - making various folders for backing up project states a thing of the past.  
We also give you practical tips for good term projects and successful software development.  
From planning with UML diagrams, using test-driven development, to the finished code.  
For inspiration, you will also find sample projects, such as HSHL's own game on the Arduboy, an Arduino-based mini-console, or templates for scientific theses.  
And of course, we also make these resources open, understandable and free to use.  
More than just code: Designing, documenting and sharing - together
