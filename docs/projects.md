!!! warning "Pay attention to the license"
    Please read and understand the **license** of a project before using (parts of) it in your work.  
    Code with **permissive** licenses such as MIT and Apache 2.0 can usually be used in your project with proper attribution.  
    Code with **copyleft** licenses such as GPL requires you to release your code as open-source as well, usually with the same license.  
    **Do not** use code **without** a license unless you have explicit approval from its authors.
