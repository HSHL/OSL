## How to use the documentation locally

GitHub automatically rebuilds the page on every commit to the main branch.
For iterating on a page, it is helpful to build the site locally on your machine. 

### Installation

`pip install mkdocs-material`

### Usage

Navigate to the root directory (OSL) and run one of the following commands in your terminal:

* `mkdocs serve` - Start the live-reloading docs server.
* `mkdocs build` - Build the documentation site.
* `mkdocs -h` - Print help message and exit.
